## Atomic Design Principle
[Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)

Atomic Design is a methodology that breaks down UI components into five categories based on their complexity and reusability:

1. **Atoms**: The smallest and most basic building blocks of the user interface. These components represent individual HTML elements and have minimal or no dependencies on other components.

2. **Molecules**: Combinations of atoms that form small, functional units of UI. Molecules are slightly more complex than atoms and often represent distinct UI elements or features.

3. **Organisms**: Larger, more complex components composed of molecules and atoms. Organisms represent reusable sections or sections of a page, such as a header, footer, or sidebar.

4. **Templates**: Complete page layouts composed of organisms, molecules, and atoms. Templates define the overall structure and layout of a page but do not contain any specific content.

5. **Pages**: Actual pages of the application, which are specific instances of templates. Pages contain the content and data relevant to a particular route or view.
