# Config Folder

The `config` folder serves as a central location for managing general configurations that are used across the entire app. These configurations help streamline various aspects of our application, including CASL abilities, app-wide settings, and Sentry integration.

## Usage

These configuration files are imported and utilized throughout our application to maintain consistency and facilitate the management of permissions, settings, and error tracking. It's important to ensure that these configurations are kept up to date and well-documented for the smooth operation of our application.

By centralizing these configurations in the `config` folder, we promote a clean and organized codebase while simplifying the process of making global changes or adjustments to our application's behavior and security.

Please refer to the individual configuration files for specific details on each aspect of the application's configuration.
