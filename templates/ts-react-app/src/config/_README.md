# Config Folder Documentation

In our React application, the `config` folder serves as a central location for managing general configurations that are used across the entire app. These configurations help streamline various aspects of our application, including CASL abilities, app-wide settings, and Sentry integration.

## CASL Abilities

[**CASL**](https://casl.js.org/) (Code Access Security Language) is a library used to manage user permissions and access control in our application. The `abilities` module in the `config` folder contains configurations related to CASL abilities.

- **`abilities.ts`**: This file defines the CASL ability rules that specify what actions users are allowed to perform on various resources within the application. It plays a crucial role in implementing fine-grained access control.

## App Configurations

The `appConfigs` module within the `config` folder contains configurations that are specific to our application's behavior, appearance, and settings.

- **`appConfig.ts`**: This file holds general application configurations, such as API endpoints, environment-specific settings, and other global variables. These settings ensure consistency and ease of maintenance throughout the app.

## Sentry Integration

[Sentry](https://sentry.io/) is an error tracking and monitoring platform that helps us identify and diagnose issues in our application. The `sentry` module in the `config` folder manages Sentry integration.

- **`sentry.ts`**: This file contains configurations related to Sentry error tracking. It includes initialization settings, error reporting, and error capturing configurations to ensure that we can monitor and resolve issues efficiently.

## Usage

These configuration files are imported and utilized throughout our application to maintain consistency and facilitate the management of permissions, settings, and error tracking. It's important to ensure that these configurations are kept up to date and well-documented for the smooth operation of our application.

By centralizing these configurations in the `config` folder, we promote a clean and organized codebase while simplifying the process of making global changes or adjustments to our application's behavior and security.

Please refer to the individual configuration files for specific details on each aspect of the application's configuration.
