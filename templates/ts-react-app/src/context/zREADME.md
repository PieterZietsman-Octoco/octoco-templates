# Context Folder

## Context API

In a TypeScript (TS) React application, managing global state can become complex, especially when multiple components need access to the same data or when data needs to be shared across different parts of the application. React Context API provides a solution to this problem by allowing you to create global state that can be accessed by any component in the component tree, without having to pass props down manually through each level.

## Why Use a Context Folder?

1. **Centralization**: By creating a dedicated folder for contexts, you centralize the management of global state within your application. This makes it easier to locate and maintain the code responsible for managing different types of state.

2. **Organization**: As your application grows, you may have multiple contexts for different types of state (e.g., authentication, theme, user preferences). Placing each context and its associated provider in its own folder helps organize the codebase and makes it easier to understand the structure of your application.

3. **Separation of Concerns**: Separating contexts into their own folders promotes a clear separation of concerns. Each context folder encapsulates the logic and functionality related to a specific type of state, reducing the likelihood of code duplication and making it easier to reason about the behavior of each context.

4. **Scalability**: As new features are added to your application, you may need to introduce new contexts to manage additional pieces of global state. Having a dedicated context folder allows you to scale your application's state management architecture efficiently without cluttering other parts of your codebase.

5. **Code Reusability**: Contexts and their associated providers can be reused across different components and even different parts of your application. Placing them in a dedicated folder makes it easier to import and use them wherever needed, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

6. **Testing**: Centralizing contexts within a dedicated folder can simplify testing. With each context and its associated provider contained within its own module, you can write focused unit tests for each context's functionality without needing to test it within the context of the entire application.
