# Layouts Folder

The layouts folder serves as a dedicated location for components responsible for laying out the structure of your application's user interface. These components typically include elements such as:

* Navigation bars 
* Sidebars
* Footers 
* Other layout-specific elements.

## Why Use a Layouts Folder?
1. **Separation of Concerns:** The layouts folder promotes a clear separation of concerns by isolating components responsible for layout-related functionality from other parts of your application. This separation makes it easier to understand and maintain the codebase, as layout-specific logic is consolidated in one location.

2. **Organization:** As your application grows, you may have multiple layout components handling different parts of the user interface, such as navigation, sidebars, or footers. Placing these components within a dedicated folder helps organize your codebase and provides a structured approach to managing layout-related code.

3. **Reusability:** Layout components often contain reusable elements such as headers, footers, or navigation menus that appear across multiple pages or sections of your application. By centralizing these components within the layouts folder, you can easily reuse them across different parts of your application, reducing code duplication and promoting consistency in design and functionality.

4. **Consistency:** Keeping layout-related components in a single folder encourages consistent design patterns and user experiences throughout your application. Developers can easily reference existing layout components when creating new pages or sections, ensuring a cohesive look and feel across the entire application.

5. **Scalability:** As your application evolves, you may need to add new layout components or modify existing ones to accommodate changing requirements or user feedback. Having a dedicated layouts folder makes it easier to manage these changes, as layout-related code is contained within a distinct area of your codebase, separate from other application logic.

6. **Testing:** The layouts folder provides a focused area for testing layout-related components and functionality. By isolating layout-specific code, you can write targeted tests to ensure that layout components render correctly and behave as expected across different screen sizes and user interactions.

7. **Collaboration:** Placing layout components within a dedicated folder facilitates collaboration among team members by providing a common location for shared layout-related code. Developers can easily locate and contribute to layout components without having to search through other parts of the codebase, streamlining the development process and promoting teamwork.
