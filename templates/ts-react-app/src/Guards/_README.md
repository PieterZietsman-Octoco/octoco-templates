# Guards Folder

In our React TypeScript project, the `guards` folder is home to various guards designed to conditionally render or allow access to specific components or routes based on certain conditions. Guards are essential for enforcing security, access control, and conditional rendering in our application.

Utilizing guards in our React TypeScript project helps us implement access control and conditional rendering effectively. These guards play a pivotal role in ensuring security, user experience, and feature management within our application.

## Auth Guard

The **Auth Guard** is a crucial guard within our application that controls access to certain routes or components based on user authentication status. This guard ensures that only authenticated users can access protected areas of our application.

- **`AuthGuard.tsx`**: This file defines the Auth Guard component responsible for checking the user's authentication status. If the user is authenticated, the guard allows the children components or routes to render; otherwise, it may redirect to a login page or show an authentication prompt.

### Usage

The Auth Guard can be utilized in our application's routing system to protect specific routes that require authentication. Here's an example of how to use the Auth Guard with the popular React Router library:

```tsx
import { Route, Redirect } from 'react-router-dom';
import AuthGuard from '../guards/AuthGuard';

// ...

<Route path="/dashboard">
  <AuthGuard>
    <Dashboard />
  </AuthGuard>
</Route>
```
In this example, the Auth Guard wraps the Dashboard component. If the user is authenticated, the Dashboard component will be rendered; otherwise, they may be redirected to a login page or shown an authentication prompt.

## Other Guards
In addition to the Auth Guard, our application may include other guards based on specific requirements. These guards can include:

- `Route Guards:` Guards that protect certain routes or route groups, restricting access based on conditions such as user roles or permissions.
- `Feature Flags:` Guards that conditionally enable or disable features based on configuration or user settings.
- `Data Guards:` Guards that ensure that data is loaded or prerequisites are met before rendering certain components.

As our application's requirements evolve, additional guards may be added to this folder to enhance security, improve user experience, or implement conditional rendering.

## Customization
Each guard can be customized to meet the specific needs of our application. You may configure guard behavior, redirection routes, and access control rules as required.

Please refer to the individual guard files and their documentation for detailed usage instructions and customization options.
