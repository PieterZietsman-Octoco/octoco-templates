# Guards Folder

The `guards` folder is home to various guards designed to conditionally render or allow access to specific components or routes based on certain conditions. Guards are essential for enforcing security, access control, and conditional rendering in our application.

Utilizing guards helps us implement access control and conditional rendering effectively. These guards play a pivotal role in ensuring security, user experience, and feature management within our application.

### Example

The Auth Guard can be utilized in our application's routing system to protect specific routes that require authentication. Here's an example of how to use the Auth Guard with the popular React Router library:

```tsx
import { Route, Redirect } from 'react-router-dom';
import AuthGuard from '../guards/AuthGuard';

// ...

<Route path="/dashboard">
  <AuthGuard>
    <Dashboard />
  </AuthGuard>
</Route>
```
In this example, the Auth Guard wraps the Dashboard component. If the user is authenticated, the Dashboard component will be rendered; otherwise, they may be redirected to a login page or shown an authentication prompt.
