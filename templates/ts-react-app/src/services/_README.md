# Services Folder

In our React application, the `services` folder is dedicated to managing API integration seamlessly and efficiently using [Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query)](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview).

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `services` folder is to centralize and organize the communication with external APIs, such as RESTful APIs or GraphQL endpoints. RTK Query simplifies the process of fetching, caching, and updating data from APIs, and the `services` folder acts as a convenient location for defining and configuring these API services.

## Customization

Each service module in the services folder can be customized to suit the specific needs of the associated API. You can adjust API endpoints, configurations, or add additional endpoints as required.

## Contributions

We welcome contributions and enhancements to our service modules. When modifying or adding services, please ensure that the changes align with our API integration strategy and follow best practices.

The services folder in our React application, powered by RTK Query, simplifies API integration by providing a centralized and efficient way to communicate with external APIs. By organizing service modules, we ensure maintainability and consistency in our data fetching and mutation logic.
