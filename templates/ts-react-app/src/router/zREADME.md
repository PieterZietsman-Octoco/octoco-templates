# Routes Folder

In our React TypeScript application, the `routes` folder serves as a central hub for managing routing information. This folder contains the configurations and definitions for various routes within our application, specifying which layouts they use and how different components are organized for different parts of the app.

## Centralization of Routing Configuration
The routes folder centralizes all routing-related configuration, making it easier to manage and maintain. By consolidating route definitions in one location, developers can quickly locate and update routing information without scattering it across different files or components.

## Configuration in **routes.ts**
The `routes.ts` file within the routes folder contains the definitions for various routes in the application. It utilizes a structured approach to define routes, groupings and specifying their paths.

## Configuration in **router.tsx**
The `router.tsx` file within the routes folder implements the routing configuration using libraries such as react-router-dom. It imports route definitions from routes.ts and maps them to corresponding components, specifying layout structures and guarding routes based on authentication status.
