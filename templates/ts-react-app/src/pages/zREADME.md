# Pages Folder

The `pages` folder plays a crucial role in structuring our project. This folder contains one file per page, and its primary responsibility is to assemble various feature components along with general UI components, following a combination of Atomic Design principles.

## Customization and Flexibility
The structure of our pages folder provides flexibility for managing different features and content on each page while keeping the individual page files simple and focused on composition.

Customization and further development of pages can be achieved by adding or modifying feature components, adjusting the layout using general components, and adhering to the principles of Atomic Design.

The pages folder in our React TypeScript application simplifies the organization of our project by dedicating each file to a specific page or view. It fosters a modular approach, enabling us to efficiently combine feature components, atoms, molecules, and other UI elements to create rich and engaging user experiences.

## Folder Structure

The `pages` folder contains individual files, each representing a specific page or view within our application. These page files are intentionally kept simple and primarily focus on gluing together different feature components and general UI components.

## Page Example

To provide a clearer picture, let's consider an example:

```tsx
// pages/HomePage.tsx

import React from 'react';
import Header from '../components/Header';
import Footer from '../components/Footer';
import FeatureComponent from '../features/FeatureComponent';

const HomePage: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <main>
        <h1>Welcome to Our App</h1>
        <FeatureComponent />
        {/* Other feature components and general components */}
      </main>
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
};

export default HomePage;
```
