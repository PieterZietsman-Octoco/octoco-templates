# Custom Hooks Folder

Custom hooks are a powerful mechanism for encapsulating reusable logic that can be shared across different components. Grouping these custom hooks within a dedicated folder offers several benefits in terms of organization, reusability, and maintainability.

## Why Use a Custom Hooks Folder?

1. **Centralization**: Placing custom hooks in a dedicated folder centralizes the reusable logic within your application. This makes it easier for developers to locate and maintain hooks that provide common functionality across multiple components.

2. **Organization**: As your application grows, you may accumulate a significant number of custom hooks. Grouping them within a single folder helps organize your codebase and provides a clear structure for developers to navigate. This can be especially valuable in larger projects with complex logic.

3. **Separation of Concerns**: Custom hooks often encapsulate specific pieces of functionality, such as data fetching, state management, or side effects. By grouping related hooks together in their own folder, you promote a clear separation of concerns and make it easier to understand the purpose of each hook.

4. **Reuse Across Components**: Custom hooks are designed to be reusable across different components and even different parts of your application. Placing them in a dedicated folder makes it straightforward to import and use them wherever needed, reducing code duplication and promoting code reusability.

5. **Scalability**: As your application evolves, you may find yourself creating new custom hooks to address new requirements or improve existing functionality. Having a dedicated folder for custom hooks allows you to scale your application's logic without cluttering other parts of your codebase.

6. **Testing**: Grouping custom hooks within a dedicated folder facilitates testing by providing a clear boundary around each piece of reusable logic. This allows you to write focused unit tests for individual hooks, ensuring they behave as expected and can be easily maintained as your application grows.

7. **Documentation**: A centralized folder for custom hooks serves as a natural location to document each hook's purpose, usage, and parameters. This documentation can help other developers understand how to use the hooks correctly and encourage consistent patterns across your codebase.
